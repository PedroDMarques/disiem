# Disiem

Diversity analysis of the dataset with the following software:
 Â 
  - Suricata
  - Bro
  - Palo Alto Firewall
  - Mcafee
  - Cisco VPN
  - Cisco Firewall
  
A single request json object from alert logs:

## Storage

Split data into overlapping timeslices and load two minute sections from each device / software combination. A register is kept for each increment of delta time, marking the file and position to continue in 2 steps. Timeslices begin at 1/2 of the previous slice to catch overlapping network sessions between the log increments. Every alert/request is loaded twice and checked with the previous and following time slice.

## Wrapper

Each software's log can contain different field names and datetime formats which require custom dictionary subclasses to abstract the interaction with the varying json structures.
